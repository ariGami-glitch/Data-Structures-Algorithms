Data Structure Side Time
ArrayList       End   ---       28.67 ms
ArrayList       Start ---       23044.67 ms
LinkedList      End   ---       26.67 ms
LinkedList      Start ---       27.33 ms

1. The data structure that was better for adding to the end was the LinkedList.
2. The data structure that was better for adding to the start was the LinkedList
as well.
3. There are small differences between the linked list and the ArrayList when
adding to the end of the list. There is also a small difference between the adding
to the end versus the start for the linked list. However, the big difference lies
in when adding to the end versus the start for the ArrayList, as well as when
comparing the time for adding to the start of the list in the ArrayList versus
linked list.
